Makersacademy exercise "Sudoku Sinatra".

The code is based on a step-by-step introduction with some open tasks as part of a Makersacademy weekly project with the purpose of practising Sinatra. 

For training the upload on Heroku / New Relic the app was uploaded in a dev and production environment (production environment can be found here: http://frozen-oasis-9048.herokuapp.com/) and a Newrelic add-on was installed.
